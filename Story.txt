Once upon a time there was a king with fine lederhose.
He had a golden Hund that he appointed as his prince to rule his kingdom.
While by his side a simple company shaped as a bratwursh.
Brot..
His mortal enemy for which he met on Hauptstrasse.
The king and his mortal enemy were very wettbewerbsfaehig, constantly duking it out.
They decided to end this feud in an Apfelkuchen eating contest. 
The kings button can be seen popping from his Lederhose.
So they travelled to the best Baeckerei in the kingdom
Driving into the sunset as friend's in the king's BMW.
They make for Berlin to enjoy a night in a Ratskeller.
